# Fundraiser-interface
 This program was created as a summative project for my grade 12 computer science class. It showcases my ability to work with structures and arrays such as filling them, printing them, and sorting them based on a specific value within them. The program is themed to be a charity fundraiser interface where guests are stopping by and making donations to the cause, the values for the amount they donate are then added to find the total amount donated while being sorted to show who donated the most. Even though this code was orginally created for the purpose of being a summative project for my grade 12 computer science class, it uses no instructor provided starter code and has been completely written by me.
